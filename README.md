False Positive Management: Mark IPs as safe to prevent accidental blocks
üîî Notification System
Discord Integration: Real-time attack alerts via webhook
In-game Notifications: Notifies admins when attacks are detected
Email Alerts: Optional email notifications for critical events
Installation
Download the latest version of NeonDDoS
Place the JAR file in your plugins folder
Restart your server
The plugin will create a default configuration
Edit the configuration as needed and use /neonddos commands to manage the system
Configuration
The config.yml file contains all configuration options:

Commands
NeonDDoS provides a comprehensive command system:

Command	Description
/neonddos status	Display protection status
/neonddos stats	Show attack statistics
/neonddos firewall	Display firewall status
/neonddos whitelist add <ip>	Add IP to whitelist
/neonddos whitelist remove <ip>	Remove IP from whitelist
/neonddos whitelist list	List whitelisted IPs
/neonddos notify <enable/disable> <ingame/discord/email/all>	Configure notifications
/neonddos analytics	Display attack analytics
/neonddos falsepositive <ip>	Mark IP as false positive
/neonddos traffic	Show traffic prioritization stats
/neonddos settraffic enabled <true/false>	Enable/disable traffic prioritization
/neonddos settraffic bandwidth <true/false>	Enable/disable dynamic bandwidth allocation
/neonddos settraffic maxrps <value>	Set max low priority requests per second
/neonddos ml	Display machine learning statistics
/neonddos mltrain	Manually train ML models
/neonddos toggleml	Enable/disable machine learning
/neonddos testdiscord	Test Discord webhook notification
Permissions
Permission	Description
neonddos.admin	Access to all NeonDDoS commands
neonddos.notifications	Receive in-game attack notifications
Setting Up Discord Notifications
Create a webhook URL in your Discord server:
Go to Server Settings > Integrations > Webhooks
Create a new webhook and copy the URL
Add the webhook URL to your config:
Test with /neonddos testdiscord command
Machine Learning System
NeonDDoS includes a sophisticated machine learning system that learns from attack patterns over time:

The system automatically trains every 30 minutes (configurable)
You can manually trigger training with /neonddos mltrain
The ML system can detect attack patterns that traditional systems might miss
It improves protection accuracy over time as it learns your server's normal traffic patterns
GeoIP Filtering
You can block or allow traffic from specific countries:

Enable GeoIP filtering in the config
Set whitelist-mode to true (only allow listed countries) or false (block listed countries)
Configure countries in the geoip.yml file that will be generated
Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Is this plugin compatible with BungeeCord/Velocity?
A: NeonDDoS is designed for standalone Spigot/Paper servers. For proxy protection, use a dedicated solution.

Q: Will this plugin affect server performance?
A: NeonDDoS is optimized to minimize performance impact during normal operation. It uses async processing for intensive operations and smart caching to maintain performance.

Q: How do I know if my server is being attacked?
A: NeonDDoS will send notifications (if configured) and you can check the attack statistics with /neonddos stats or detailed analytics with /neonddos analytics.

Q: How do I unblock an IP that was incorrectly blocked?
A: Use the /neonddos falsepositive <ip> command to mark it as a false positive and unblock it from the firewall.

Q: Does this plugin work with a dynamic IP address?
A: Yes, it tracks IPs individually and does not rely on your server's public IP for protection.

Future Updates
We're continually improving NeonDDoS with new features and enhancements. Stay tuned!
